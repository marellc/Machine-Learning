Good work discussing the performance of the tuned model, and congrats on improving the accuracy and F-score!

If you're interested, you could also experiment with improving the F1 test score by tuning other parameters. For example...

parameters = {'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1],
              'subsample': [0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.],
              'max_features': [0.8, 0.9, None],
              'max_depth': [1, 2, 3]}

# The default grid search uses 3 folds; use the 'cv' param to specify more
grid_obj = GridSearchCV(clf, parameters, cv=4,
                        scoring=scorer, n_jobs=-1)
